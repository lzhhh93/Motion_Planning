# Motion_Planning

Here are 8 Projects I have done about the topic motion planing.

The 8th project is the whole design for Quadrotor in a lattice map, which is mz biggest project, the others are the popular algorithms for motion planning. 

Project 1 C++

A* search
JPS search

Project 2 MATLAB C++ (OMPL)

RRT*

Project 4 C++

Minimal Snap Trajectory Generatio

Project 6 PYTHON

RTDP(Real Time Dynamic Programming) algorithm for car racing problem 

Project 7 Matlab

MPC for 2 problems

Project 8 C++
A whole Design for the motion planing modul of Quadrotor in lattice map
